## ABOUT ME...

I am a third-year student in a double major program, Actuary and Data Science, with a 45% scholarship due to academic excellence at the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico (ITAM). At the university, I pro-actively participate in extracurricular activities, such as "Data+Algorithms+Society ITAM Center" where we work on projects for the benefit of society. On top of that, I have won the Academic Excellence Award for achieving extraordinary academic results. My studies have helped me to become an independent and reliable individual and allowed me to acquire exceptional communication and leadership skills. 

I love reading and sports. In the same way, I really like outdoor activities. Traveling and exploring different cultures and places is something magical for me. I like to work as a team and enrich my colleagues in the same way that I can learn from them. Perseverance, effort and creativity have shown me that there are no limits to the human mind. That is why I strive to improve these skills day by day.
