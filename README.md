### Template
Millennial is a minimalist Jekyll theme for running a simple, clean, content-focused publishing platform for your publication site or blog through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or on your own server. 

### Abstract
In this repository, you will find my personal github page. Within this page, you can take a look at my resume, my main interests or hobbies and a glimpse of the structuring of the project, of which I was a participant, Lima Buend√≠a.
